# Description

FluentAssertions have changed their license and starting from version 8.0.0 all developers that are contributing must have a valid license.

The cost of the license does not match the value received from the package, and it has been decided that we won't upgrade to version 8.

This action will check a dependency file generated by dotnet for any forbidden versions.

The dependency file can be generated by this command from dotnet.

``` bash
# optional - do a restore first, otherwise the output can be unpredictable
dotnet restore 'path/to/solution-or-project-file'

# generate dependency file
dotnet list 'path/to/solution-or-project-file' --format json > dependency.json
```
